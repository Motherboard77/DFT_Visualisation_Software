# DFT_Visualisation_Software
The software, written in C++ standard 11, compiled using MINGW compiler, with built-in graphics functionality, is a basic software catering to visualisation of the magnitude spectrum after the transformation of a continuous time signal to the frequency domain by employing the discrete fourier transform(DFT).
