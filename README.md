# DFT_Visualisation_Software
The software, written in C++0x, compiled using MINGW (GNU GCC) compiler, with integrated graphics library, is a basic software catering to visualisation of the magnitude spectrum after the transformation of a continuous time signal to the frequency domain by employing the discrete fourier transform(DFT). This version of the software takes the easy route of hardcoding the signal values beforehand, prior to sampling and taking the frequency transformation. However, in future, the idea is to customize the signal parameters during runtime apart from signal selection. The plotting is done using the in-package graphics.h library that is integrated into the program.
